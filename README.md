Project plan
â†’ I am developing a web application designed for shoe enthusiasts and collectors to efficiently track their shoe collections. This application allows users to organize and manage their inventory by categorizing shoes they own, while also having a separate tab that displays all shoes added. This overall simplifies the process of keeping tabs on multiple pairs.

Collection tab: Display of database 
Shoe tab: Where user can do CRUD applications
